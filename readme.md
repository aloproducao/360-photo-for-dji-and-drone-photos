# 360 Photo Viewer for DJI Drone

The 360 Photo Viewer for DJI Drone is a web application originally created to view 360-degree images captured by DJI drones. This application allows users to upload their own panoramic images and interact with them in an immersive 3D environment.

## Key Features

### 360 Photo Viewing
- The application uses the [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) library to create a 3D environment where panoramic photos can be displayed.
- Panoramic images are displayed as a surrounding "sky" (skybox) in a virtual setting.

### Camera Controls
- Users can control the position of the virtual camera within the 3D environment.
- Mouse scrolling allows users to adjust the field of view (FOV) of the camera, providing greater flexibility in viewing panoramic images.

### Dark Theme
- The application supports a dark theme for a more enjoyable viewing experience in low-light environments.

### Image Switching
- Users can upload their own panoramic images by simply dragging and dropping an image file into the application or by selecting it through an upload button.
- When a new image is loaded, the previous panoramic image is replaced, allowing users to easily switch between different views.

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the application in a compatible web browser.
2. To switch between the light and dark themes, click the "Change Theme" button located in the top left corner of the screen.
3. Use the mouse scroll wheel to adjust the field of view of the virtual camera and obtain different perspectives of the panoramic image.
4. To load a new panoramic image, click the "Select Image" button or simply drag and drop an image file into the application. The new image will replace the current panoramic image.

## Technical Requirements

- Modern web browser with WebGL support (recommended: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
- Panoramic images in the correct format (360 degrees) for proper viewing.

This application provides an immersive and interactive experience for exploring DJI drone panoramic images in a 3D environment, making it a useful tool for aerial photography enthusiasts and professionals looking to review and share their panoramic images in an immersive way.
